# Project_IDF_Operation_First_Strike

For Targeted Strikes

Within the IDF framework, there are two main units involved in this process, including Military Intelligence (Aman) and the strike units.
Aman provides the intelligence for the strike, while the strike units provide the operational details and assess whether the weapon or tool is suitable for the intended strike.

In the case of Hamas, we have a list of terrorists and a list of target locations in gasa.
